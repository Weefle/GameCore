You can use the plugin on your server without any restrictions.

You may use the code in your jar path, and as long as the code of this isn't
in your plugin, you may use this freely without giving me credit(this
has then to be needed for your plugin to work)

If you have plans on using the code of this plugin in your project,
you might do it, but can't claim credit for the copied code.

If you are releasing a plugin containing the code of this plugin,
remember to give me a credit for the classes, or atleast
add a comment in the code stated that its created by
gronnmann.
